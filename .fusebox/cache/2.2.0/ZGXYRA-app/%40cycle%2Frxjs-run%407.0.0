 * **Example:**
 * ```js

 *
 * The `main` function expects a collection of "source" Observables (returned
 * from drivers) as input, and should return a collection of "sink" Observables
 * (to be given to drivers). A "collection of Observables" is a JavaScript
 * object where keys match the driver names registered by the `drivers` object,
 * and values are the Observables. Refer to the documentation of each driver to
 * see more details on what types of sources it outputs and sinks it receives.
 *

 * and outputs a collection of `sinks` Observables.
 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values
 * are driver functions.
 * @return {Function} a dispose function, used to terminate the execution of the
 * Cycle.js program, cleaning up resources used.

 * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application
